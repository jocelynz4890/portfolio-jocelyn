# Reflecting on lecture 6: Concept Design Moves


The ideas of loosening/tightening and unifying/specializing introduced during lecture got me thinking about some of the design choices of technology I've used, and I just wanted to share a couple of examples here.

## ðŸ”´ Elevators 
So I interned at Amazon last summer, and the elevator bay had these fancy digital displays to select your desired floor number. This meant that the only buttons you had to push were outside the elevator, and the inside didn't have any number pads or anything. They looked sort of like this:

![](/elevator.png){:width='200'}

This design is a tightening of the concepts of selecting a direction to go (up or down) with selecting an exact floor number. Typically, you would select the general direction you want to go in outside the elevator, then inside the elevator, you would pick a floor number.

So when I came back to MIT after my internship, for the first couple of times I used an elevator, I would push the 'up' or 'down' button, get in the elevator, and stand there like an idiot until the elevator doors opened back up since I hadn't selected a floor. I still forget that I have to select a floor when I get in an elevator sometimes!

## ðŸ”´ LinkedIn: following vs connecting
When I first started using LinkedIn, I had to look up the difference between following vs connecting with someone. 

![](/follow.png){:width='400'}

Most other social media have only the one-way follow option, but LinkedIn offers both a two-way relationship (connecting) and the usual one-way relationship (following). This loosening of the concept of following into both a one-way and two-way relationship option makes sense for LinkedIn, where you can connect with people you know in real life, or follow popular figures (who you can't expect a follow back from). The two-way connection option can also be seen as a tightening, since it automates/simplifies the process of two people having to follow each other separately.

## ðŸ”´ Outlook meeting invites
Finally, I wanted to look at Outlook meeting invites, which can be a bit confusing at first since there are so many options. The response options look like this:

![](/outlook.png){:width='500'}

There are **accept**, **tentative**, and **decline** options, for each of which you can select whether you want to **respond** (notifying the meeting host) or not, and if you choose to respond, you can further choose to **comment** to provide an explanation to the host. This streamlines the communication process by providing the invitee a set of options to choose from, and notifies the inviter accordingly.

When accepting an invite, the event is automatically put onto your calendar. Overall, this concept is a tightening since it combines the concepts of responding to an invite and putting it on your calendar.
