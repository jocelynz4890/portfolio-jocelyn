# Gestalt Principles in the Visual Design of Duolingo

## Proximity
Duolingo’s design uses proximity to group related elements, like lessons, user profile items, navigation to different pages, and notification cards. This layout makes it easy to perceive these elements as distinct sets of tasks, directing attention to the right place at the right time. For example, the user mainly uses the middle column of the page to do the lessons, but can easily navigate using the left side of the page, where there is a column of navigable pages. The proximity of related elements reduces the effort needed to navigate the interface, letting users quickly understand what’s connected and where to focus next.

## Similarity
The principle of similarity comes through in Duolingo’s consistent use of colors, shapes, and icons for related functions. Circular icons denote different lessons, creating recognizable visual patterns. Colors are consistently applied to progress bars and achievement markers, making it easier to distinguish between completed and in-progress tasks. This uniformity helps users recognize visual relationships and stay oriented within the app.

This image shows how the principles of proximity and similarity are used in conjunction on the home page:

## Continuity
The app’s linear progression embodies the principle of continuity, presenting lessons in a top-to-bottom path that visually represents the step-by-step process of language learning. The design guides the eyes naturally from one lesson to the next, reinforcing the idea of a continuous journey. This linear arrangement reduces cognitive load, making it clear which task comes next and encouraging a smooth progression through the learning path. Note that Duolingo also breaks the long path of one language into sections to reduce the intimidating length of the linear progression of lessons.

## Closure
Even when elements aren’t fully complete, the UI suggests a sense of wholeness. Skill icons with partially filled progress rings hint at a complete circle, motivating users to finish lessons and “close” the shape. This subtle use of closure provides an extra push to learners to achieve their goals, creating a satisfying visual experience when a task is completed.

This shows that the lesson is not yet finished:

This shows the individual progress of learning each letter:

This shows achievement progress:

## Figure-Ground
To help users focus, Duolingo uses color and contrast to distinguish between foreground and background elements. Active tasks and clickable features, like lessons, are more brightly colored and have animations that capture the user's attention, while secondary features, such as settings or leaderboards or locked lessons that cannot be interacted with, have a more muted appearance. This visual hierarchy draws attention to the most important elements, allowing users to stay focused on their current learning objectives without unnecessary distractions.

You can see from this example that Duolingo also switches the color of subsections of the learning path to keep things new for the user (so they don't get bored, and to also make them feel like they are making progress). This helps make the learning path visual element feel like it is in the foreground.

The use of color here puts the current lesson in the foreground and the locked lessons in the background.
