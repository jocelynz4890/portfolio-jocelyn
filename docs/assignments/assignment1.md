# üîç Needfinding
## üí° Preparations

To learn more about user's opinions about social media, I narrowed in on an initial theme that I wanted to explore through interviews:


::: info Theme
As younger social media users have increased and platforms have increasingly added features designed to take advantage of people's attention spans to generate more revenue, how might I design a social media platform for young people and elderly people, or anyone who may be wanting a ‚Äòdetox‚Äô from current social media [anyone who may be wanting a ‚Äòdetox‚Äô from current social media](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/well/family/social-media-usage-teens.html)? I know many people who have refused to create a social media profile or deleted their accounts to stay safe or mentally healthy. A solution to this issue may be particularly beneficial for the children and elderly, since they could be at higher risk of falling victim to doomscrolling and the addiction of social media.

Based on this theme, I decided to interview people from a generation different from mine: one younger and one older. My hope was that interviewing people of different ages would allow me to gain some insight into how they differ in their purpose for using social media, as well as aspects of a platform that they notice or features they tend to use differently. Thorough justification for choosing interviewees. Both participants are not current college students/affiliates, or differ from you substantially in some way. Perceptive questions that cover a breadth and depth of issues. Anticipates some opportunities for follow-ups.

I brainstormed some conversation starters:
::: details List of questions
- What social media do you use? If multiple, which do you use more? What aspects of it are you drawn to that the others don‚Äôt have or are lacking in?
- (For each platform) What is your general opinion about the healthiness of social media? How safe do you feel on social media and what contributes to that?
- When you first began using the platform, how did your opinion of the healthiness/safety of the platform change (or not)?
- Does the platform cause distress or worry in any way while using it?
- Did you have any disappointing or scary experiences while communicating with someone over social media? If not, did you ever witness it? Were events like this common?
- What do you think caused it? Was it because the platform couldn‚Äôt sufficiently convey meaning?
- How do you feel about the level of anonymity you are able to have on social media, and does this have any advantages or drawbacks?
- Do you generally try to hide your identity or keep it very public? What is the degree to which you reveal information about your personal life?
- How does that impact your experience with the platform? Did any particular positive of negative events occur as a result of that level of transparency?
- Did you ever find yourself drifting to other communities or trying to communicate with people very different from you?
- What was your general impression of the people using the platform in terms of friendliness?
- What kind of people do you mostly interact with on social media? Strangers, people you already know in real life, or maybe you don‚Äôt like to interact with anyone?
- Have you ever witnessed how any very young or very old people are treated on social media? There have been an increasing amount of older influencers worldwide (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/style/korea-tiktok-seniors.html, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/15/style/dorothylovesnewyork-dorothy-wiggins.html) and even younger people are starting to use social media (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/well/family/child-social-media-use.html).

## üìù Interview 1 Summary Report

The first person I interviewed was 13 years old.

Conduct your interviews and then, for each interview, write a 1‚Äì2 paragraph report that summarizes each interview and analyzes some key takeaways. For instance, did a participant share a particularly memorable annecdote? What did you observe about their behavior that you found surprising or unusual (and why did you find it surprising/unusual)? What stood out to you in the conversation? Consider how you might quote participants directly to provide some interesting texture to your analysis

## üìù Interview 2 Summary Report

The second person I interviewed was 50 years old.

Goes beyond a summary to richly characterizes surprises, contradictions, and tensions surfaced in the interview. Quotes from participants are well-chosen to add insightful texture.	


## üöÄ Design Opportunities

Folowing the interviews, I identified a few oppotunities to explore further:

-  
- 
- 
- 
- 

Following these summary reports, bullet point 3‚Äì5 design opportunities you plan to explore in subsequent assignments. For each bullet point, spend a few sentences briefly describing what the opportunity you envision is, and why you think this opportunity is worth exploring (i.e., why might users care, what difference might a corresponding design make, etc.). At least 3 compelling opportunities, which do not suggest straightforward solutions, are bulleted. Every bullet conveys a crisp, descriptive definition of the opportunity. Explanations for why opportunities might matter are well-argued and well-grounded in evidence from the interviews.
