# üîç Needfinding
## üí° Preparations

To learn more about user's opinions about social media, I narrowed in on an initial theme that I wanted to explore through interviews:


::: info Theme
As younger social media users have increased and platforms have increasingly added features designed to take advantage of people's attention spans to generate more revenue, how might I design a social media platform for young people and elderly people, or [anyone who may be wanting a ‚Äòdetox‚Äô from current social media](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/well/family/social-media-usage-teens.html)? I know many people who have refused to create a social media profile or deleted their accounts to stay safe or mentally healthy. A solution to this issue may be particularly beneficial for children and the elderly, since they could be at higher risk of falling victim to doomscrolling and the addiction of social media.
:::


Based on this theme, I decided to interview people from a generation different from mine: one younger and one older. My hope was that interviewing people of different ages would allow me to gain some insight into how they differ in the things they notice about social media and types of people they interact with on social media, as well as features they tend to use differently. I decided to interview one of my two younger brothers, who is 13, and my foster mom, who is 50. 


I brainstormed some conversation starters related to this theme, making sure to include questions that would prompt stories and possible explorations into different topics:
::: details List of questions
- What social media do you use? If multiple, which is your favorite and why? What aspects of it are you drawn to that the others don‚Äôt have or are lacking in?
- What is your general opinion about the healthiness of social media? How safe do you feel on social media and what contributes to that?
- When you first began using the platform, how did your opinion of the healthiness/safety of the platform change (or not)?
- Does the platform cause distress or worry in any way while using it?
- Did you have any disappointing or scary experiences while communicating with someone over social media? If not, did you ever witness it? How common were events like this?
- How does the level of anonymity you are able to have on social media affect your actions and emotions, and does this have any advantages or drawbacks? 
- What are some ways that you act differently on social media than in real life?
- Do you generally try to hide your identity or keep it very public? What is your stance on revealing information about your personal life?
- How does that impact your experience with the platform? Did any particular positive of negative events occur as a result of that level of transparency?
- Have you ever found yourself drifting to other communities or trying to communicate with people very different from you on social media?
- What was your general impression of the people using the platform in terms of friendliness or likeability?
- What kind of people do you mostly interact with on social media? Strangers, people you already know in real life, or maybe you don‚Äôt like to interact with anyone?
- Have you ever witnessed how any very young or very old people are treated on social media? There have been an [increasing amount of older influencers worldwide](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/style/korea-tiktok-seniors.html) and even [younger people are starting to use social media more](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/well/family/child-social-media-use.html).

Note that during interviews, I also asked more follow-up questions depending on the interviewee's responses.

The first person I interviewed was my 13 year old brother, who plays a lot of video games and so mostly uses platforms such as Discord for communicating with others playing the same games. He also described how he sometimes used the video calling feature of Discord to get help on his schoolwork with older friends he knew in person, but that it was difficult to follow instructions while screensharing, such as where to click on webpage. He also explained that he preferred being helped in person, since he could easily write things out or have the other person point to the screen. He also uses Reddit, Quora, and Twitter/X for keeping up to date with news about events in the games that he plays, as well as for answering general-purpose questions. I found it surprising that despite claiming to use social media almost purely for gathering intel on games, he stated that his overall impression of Twitter was that it was "you know, traumatizing". His behavior indicated that what he had witnessed to support this impression was common. He elaborated by describing some of the death threats he had seen. He also described a need for more human verification on some platforms, describing an instance in which he saw a bot that would impersonate people to take their passwords. He said that he "doesn't really get posting pictures of food" on social media "to get praised for it", although some of his friends did, and that he preferred to showcase his the things he took pride in on his Youtube channel.

A particularly memorable anecdote he had while going on a tangent about Pokemon Go (as an example of how an online event translated into a real-life meetup) was about how during an in-game event, he had gone outside and met up in real life with a stranger playing the game. I followed up by asking about whether he had had any reservations; after all, he was going to meet a stranger, to which he explained that Pokemon Go ‚Äúforces you to work with other people in real life‚Äù, and that he often met adults that had kids with them, even describing them as "nice". I was also surprised that he felt safe on most platforms despite previously describing Twitter as "traumatizing", even stating that "safety isn't really needed on [Discord] since there's a lot of moderation". He even described how he often met people online through games that he would chat with on Discord, only to realize their true age: ‚ÄúI thought this guy was my age but he was like nine‚Äù. He also unexpectedly met a 30 year old math teacher at a Texas high school through voice chat, and recounted details about them in a way that made it seem that he had really gotten to know them. I was surprised since he had previously claimed that he didn't have any reason to talk to people online unless he already knew them, and that he didn't actively go looking for online friends. He clarified that he would "talk to people, but not really get to know them" unless they were together for a while, such as in a game. He also described having "more of an urge to say something in real life", which speaking probably contributed to (rather than texting).

The second person I interviewed was my 50 year old foster mom, who used Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest mostly for talking to similar people and "seeing what they're up to", as well as for "getting happy" by looking at animal pictures. She wished that she could see new content aside from the same content that she always saw, after showing that her and her husband's explore pages were vastly different. She also expressed that she wanted to view content that wasn't time wasting and instead "makes you smarter". She also expressed general disinterest in "putting personal stuff out there", and that she had witnessed arguments in comment sections that she willingly got involved in. I followed up by asking if this caused her to have a negative impression of the platform, to which she explained that she didn't really care because they were just a "random person". She also explained her perspective as a parent: that there should be filters or some sort of safety measure for kids. As a foster parent, she always put limitations on screen time since kids need "in-person human interactions" in order to develop emotional intelligence. One thing she liked about social media, though, was its ability to reconnect people that had lost contact with each other over the years.

A particularly memorable anecdote that she shared was about the topic of feeling safe on social media: she works for the government, in a sensitive position that requires a spotless record. When she applied for the job, they had found a picture of her that was taken by someone else and posted on Facebook without her knowledge. They questioned her about it since the picture had been taken at an exposing angle. There were other instances she recounted of people finding her social media and using her profile pictures in their presentation slides at work without her knowledge. Another anecdote she had was of an experience she had that was "better than using social media" to connect with people. When she was in Jakarta, there was a human library where you could check people (rather than books) out for a certain amount of time, based on their characteristics or profession. This would allow you to speak with them and learn more from them, after which you return them. I followed up by suggesting that it seemed she preferred real-life interaction to online interactions, to which she clarified on her reason for using social media. She explained that she "doesn't use social media to be social", which surprised me since she had earlier claimed that she used it to communicate with people. She elaborated further, citing a possible "generational difference" to be the reason why she just wanted to "turn off [her] brain" on social media, and that when she was on social media, she "didn't want to interact with human beings anymore" and instead just look at pictures and watch videos. It was interesting to observe that older generations might see more of a disconnect between their social lives and social media; where younger generations may see social media as an inherent part of our social lives, older generations may see it only as a form of entertainment. We also had a discussion about the difficulty of maintaining online relationships, which oftentimes ends up becoming work.


## üöÄ Design Opportunities

Following the interviews, I identified a few opportunities to explore further:

-  **A platform for younger kids, or in general, a platform for talking to only people you already know in real life and that encourages in-person meetups.** Users might care about themselves or their kids staying safe on social media; both my younger brother and foster mom had noticed the toxic environment that social media can be. It would relieve parents of the burden of having to monitor their kid's online presence, and allow kids to interact in a safe bubble while encouraging more in-person interactions and social development.
- **A platform that makes it easy to teach or explain things in a casual one-on-one video call environment that simulates the advantages of being together in-person as closely as possible.** Users such as students might care about this if they are hoping to learn something from someone else, but are not physically close enough to meet up. This opportunity seems extremely malleable: it could be used for services such as tech support who will often have to guide customers through complicated sites. It would transform the disconnected experience of communicating online and make it more personal.
- **A platform that doesn't feel "time wasting", perhaps by helping the user develop a skill or learn something in addition to the basic features of social media (browsing content, posting content).** Users might care about this since many people gain satisfaction from self improvement, whether that is tied to achieving goals in video games or by learning something. Injecting educative content into a user's social media feed could help them remain aware of the time they are spending on social media, leading to improved mental health.
- **A platform that separates entertainment and social features, perhaps by hiding one mode when the other is active.** Users might care about this because there are certain times where they may be craving one side without the other, for example, when they are trying to be productive versus when they are trying to "turn their brain off". This might help people avoid doomscrolling and wasting their time, or relax without being forced to have human interactions.
